## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v18.x or later)
- **npm** (v9.x or later)
- **MongoDB** *(Optional — the server will automatically provide an in-memory database if no external database instance is detected)*

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/avanthikasreejith8923-a11y/studyhive.git
cd studyhive
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Install all required packages across both client and server:
```bash
npm run install:all
```

### 3. Environment Configuration
Copy the provided environment templates and configure your application parameters:

- **Server:** Copy `server/.env.example` to `server/.env` to configure your database connection, secret keys, and service settings.
- **Client:** Copy `client/.env.example` to `client/.env` to configure your client application endpoints.

### 4. Run the Application
Launch both the backend API and frontend client concurrently:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application client will open in your default browser.

## 🛡️ Administrative Console & Promotion

StudyHive includes a role-based moderation system. To elevate an account to **Head Librarian** (Admin):

1. Register an account within the application.
2. In your terminal, navigate to the `server/` folder and execute the promotion script:
   ```bash
   node scripts/makeAdmin.js <username_or_email>
   ```
3. Upon signing in, the designated account will gain access to the **Admin** dashboard in the navigation bar.

## 🔒 Security & Quality Standards

- **Input Sanitization:** All incoming requests (chat messages, usernames, hive names, task titles) are strictly sanitized against injection attacks.
- **Socket Authentication:** WebSocket connections require verified JWT tokens upon connection; unauthenticated handshakes are rejected.
- **Rate Limiting:** Critical endpoints (authentication, account creation, assistant requests) are protected against automated abuse.
- **Atomic Operations:** Desk claiming and currency transactions employ atomic check-and-set operations to prevent race conditions.
